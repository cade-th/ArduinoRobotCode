Log of Things Done:

1. Separated .ino code into src and header files for readablity
	- This meant working through a lot of arudino quirks
	- also meant learning the meaning of the "extern" keyword
	- needed to make all global variables in the header extern
	- assignments for global variables go in src file

2. Added Ultrasonc sensor test code
    - All functionality achieved
	- Need to move based on data from device
    - Motors not working

3. Separate all code into each device-specific header files
    - "mane.h" and "mane.cpp" are the entry points from the arduino.ino file"
