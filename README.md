Log of Things Done:

1. Separated .ino code into src and header files for readablity
	- This meant working through a lot of arudino quirks
	- also meant learning the meaning of the "extern" keyword
	- needed to make all global variables in the header extern
	- assignments for global variables go in src file

2. Added Ultrasonc sensor test code
	- need to test device
	- move based on data from device
